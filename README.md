# SVG-Website-entry-animation
The SVG was generated using figma.com (alternative to photoshop, free, found online). Copied and pasted it into HTMl, then used 
Keyframes within CSS to create the animation. Both fading it and moving.

Could later extend to click the enter website button, or could be altered to have the logo slide all the way to the top,
decrease in size, and website fade in.
